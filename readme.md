### Chrome Extension, opens YouTube channels of independent Russian media

This extension helps to promote independent YouTube channels that tell truth about the war in Ukraine. It opens a list of trusted channels and plays/likes videos from these channels. 

It is needed to compete with Putin's army of internet bots that are boosting channels with false information about the war and helping to brainwash Russian people. 

Independent channels are DW, Radio Freedom, Max Katz, Vladimir Milov, Michael Nacki, Navalny Live, Michael Khodorkovsky, Yulia Latynina, Popular Politics, Ilya Yashin, Ekaterina Shulman.
These are the last few independent channels left in Russia.
